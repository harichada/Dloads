UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMPUTING SYSTEM CONTAINING US GOVERNMENT OR STATE OF CALIFORNIA INFORMATION IS A CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE SECTION 502 AND/OR APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW AND IS SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

Use in a manner other than as intended by the State of California may result in the forfeiture of access privileges. All computing system activities may be recorded and monitored. Individuals using these systems expressly consent to such monitoring and shall have no expectation of privacy in their use.

#   Server Certificate Chain:
