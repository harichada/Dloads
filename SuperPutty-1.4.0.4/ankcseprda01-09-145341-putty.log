[1mwhereis(B[m [1mCommand(B[m

[1mPurpose(B[m

       Locates source, binary, or manual for program.

[1mSyntax(B[m

       [1mwhereis(B[m [ [1m-s(B[m ] [ [1m-b(B[m ] [ [1m-m(B[m ] [ [1m-u(B[m ] [ { { [1m-S(B[m | [1m-B(B[m | [1m-M(B[m } Directory ... }... [1m-f(B[m ] File ...

[1mDescription(B[m

       The [1mwhereis(B[m command locates the source, binary, and manuals sections for specified files. The supplied names are
       first stripped of leading path name components and any (single) trailing extension of the form .ext (for example,
       [1m.c(B[m). Prefixes of [1ms.(B[m resulting from use of the Source Code Control System (see [1mSCCS(B[m) are also dealt with. The command
       then attempts to find the desired program from a list of standard locations.

       A usage message is returned if a bad option is entered. In other cases, no diagnostics are provided.

[1mFlags(B[m

       If any of the [1m-b,(B[m [1m-s,(B[m [1m-m(B[m or [1m-u(B[m flags are given, the [1mwhereis(B[m command searches only for binary, source, manual, or
       unusual sections respectively (or any two thereof).
       Item
            Description
       [1m-b(B[m
            Searches for binary sections of a file.
       [1m-m(B[m
            Searches for manual sections of a file.
       [1m-s(B[m
            Searches for source sections of a file.
       [1m-u(B[m
            Searches for unusual files. A file is said to be unusual if it does not have one entry of each requested type.
            Entering whereis -m -u * asks for those files in the current directory which have no documentation.

       The [1m-B,(B[m [1m-M,(B[m and [1m-S(B[m flags can be used to change or otherwise limit the places where the [1mwhereis(B[m command searches.
       Since the program uses the [1mchdir(B[m subroutine to run faster, path names given with the [1m-M,(B[m [1m-S(B[m and [1m-B(B[m flag directory
       list must be full; for example, they must begin with a [1m/(B[m (slash).
       Item
            Description
       [1m-B(B[m
            Like [1m-b(B[m, but adds a directory to search. Change or limit the places where the [1mwhereis(B[m command searches for
            binaries.
       [1m-M(B[m
            Like [1m-m(B[m, but adds a directory to search. Change or limit the places where the [1mwhereis(B[m command searches for
            manual sections.
       [1m-S(B[m
            Like [1m-s(B[m, but adds a directory to search. Change or limit the places where the [1mwhereis(B[m command searches for
            sources

            Terminates the last [1m-M,(B[m [1m-S(B[m or [1m-B(B[m directory list and signal the start of file names.

[1mExamples(B[m

       To find all of the files in the [1m/usr/ucb(B[m directory that either are not documented in the [1m/usr/man/man1(B[m directory or
       do not have source in the [1m/usr/src/cmd(B[m directory, enter:
